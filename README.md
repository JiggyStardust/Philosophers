# Philosophers

This project is about learning the basics of threading in a process.

Started working on this with my MacOS on Saturday 25th of Jan.
- Makefile
- header
- getting familiar with the assignment and learning about threads and mutexes.

Going to continue working with Linux on 1st of Feb and do possible necessary adjustments then.

PS. ISNT ACTUALLY LIBFT AUTHORIZED SO GONNA REMOVE LIBFT LATER

PPS. Just started to play with gettimeofday so nothing makes sense yet.

---------------------------------------------------------------
4th of February (Was supposed to continue on 1st, but got sick)
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Continued working on the project after going on holiday and being sick
- mostly trying to get familiar with the requirements again
- totally misusing gettimeofday now
- Removed Libft cause it's not allowed
- Scrapped up new ft_atoi_err, because my older custom ft_atoi was way
too liberal in terms of characters it allowed in. 
- The struct is just a doodle, not gonna utilize it this way
