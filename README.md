This project is about learning the basics of threading in a process.

Started working on this with my MacOS on Saturday 25th of Jan.
- Makefile
- header
- getting familiar with the assignment and learning about threads and mutexes.

Going to continue working with Linux on 1st of Feb and do possible necessary adjustments then.

PS. ISNT ACTUALLY LIBFT AUTHORIZED SO GONNA REMOVE LIBFT LATER

PPS. Just started to play with gettimeofday so nothing makes sense yet.
